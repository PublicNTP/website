          Growing up in Denver, Colorado, I'd often ask my parents if they'd let me call the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/pml/time-and-frequency-division/services/telephone-time-day-ttds">NIST Telephone Time-of-Day Service</a> in the nearby city of Boulder to hear the current time according to the atomic clocks.

          During my college years, friends rolled their eyes when they saw me calibrating my wristwatch with the atomic time on the University central servers. As I became deeply interested in Linux system adminstration, it was a near-certainty to find an NTP daemon running on any host I had root privs on.

          I founded PublicNTP in 2008 based on a deeply-held belief that highly-accurate time data should be provided as an unrestricted public service, open to all systems on the Internet.

          With a personal goal to contribute to PublicNTP by donating time to personally install stratum one servers in portions of the world where the network has relatively few accurate, reliable, low-latency NTP servers, the project doubles as an excellent opportunity for me to travel to relatively-exotic locationsâ€”something I enjoy immensely.
