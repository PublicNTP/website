          Growing up in Denver, Colorado, I'd often ask my parents if they'd let me call the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/pml/time-and-frequency-division/services/telephone-time-day-ttds">NIST Telephone Time-of-Day Service</a> in the nearby city of Boulder to hear the current time according to the atomic clocks.

          During my college years, friends rolled their eyes when they saw me calibrating my wristwatch with the atomic time on the University central servers. As I became deeply interested in Linux system adminstration, it was a near-certainty to find an NTP daemon running on any host I had root privs on.

          I founded PublicNTP in 2008 based on a deeply-held belief that highly-accurate time data should be provided as an unrestricted public service, open to all systems on the Internet.

					With a personal goal to contribute by donating time to personally install stratum one servers in portions of the world where the network has relatively few accurate, reliable, low-latency NTP servers, PublicNTP doubles as an excellent opportunity for me to travel to relatively-exotic locations‚Äîsomething I enjoy immensely.

					I‚Äôve always had a passion for solving complex problems, but I‚Äôve never liked to do it the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù way. For 18 years, I got a strong foundation in rigorous discipline as an Officer in the Air National Guard, while simultaneously pursuing my passion for technology in electrical engineering. Transitioning to the software development process in 2003 was a natural evolution for me. The digital product space is still the Wild West of technology, a place you can imagine an idea, prototype it quickly and cheaply, and bring it to market on your own (or at least with a small, tight team). There‚Äôs an ethos you have to follow, sure, but how you do it isn‚Äôt as important as that you get it done. Currently, I‚Äôm CIO of Boncom, a digital company I helped build from the ground up, and an author and creator of the Rebellious Learning brand. I‚Äôm a huge advocate for renegade product makers out to change the world.

					I'm a second generation Computer Scientist, and a third generation
					Auburn Tiger (some of the other board members refer to them as the
					"War Eagles", ignore them, they know nothing). One of those matters
					much more during football season. I met Terry and Dan on my first day
					as a graduate student at Purdue, and the rest is history. For a little
					more info about me, my background is heavily skewed towards computer
					security and low-level programming. I've had the good fortune of being
					involved with Cyberguard (now McAffee), Arxan Technologies, Microsemi,
					and Mercury Systems.

					At some point in our storied history, Terry recommended Hackers by
					Stephen Levy. It does a great job of expressing what I love about this
					community, and more importantly the ethos that we should all exhibit.
					I joined the board because Terry asked me, and I agreed that it's a
					really important and generally neglected service. We'd been casually
					participating in things by running a box in Chicago, and taking the
					next logical step seemed like a great idea. After interacting with the
					other people involved in the project, it became clear to me very
					quickly that not getting involved would be a bad decision. Everyone
					has the right mindset, the right ethos, and the right goals. We (I am
					proud to include myself) are dedicated to providing a critical
					service that everyone takes for granted.
