          Growing up in Denver, Colorado, I'd often ask my parents if they'd let me call the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/pml/time-and-frequency-division/services/telephone-time-day-ttds">NIST Telephone Time-of-Day Service</a> in the nearby city of Boulder to hear the current time according to the atomic clocks.

          During my college years, friends rolled their eyes when they saw me calibrating my wristwatch with the atomic time on the University central servers. As I became deeply interested in Linux system adminstration, it was a near-certainty to find an NTP daemon running on any host I had root privs on.

          I founded PublicNTP in 2008 based on a deeply-held belief that highly-accurate time data should be provided as an unrestricted public service, open to all systems on the Internet.

					With a personal goal to contribute by donating time to personally install stratum one servers in portions of the world where the network has relatively few accurate, reliable, low-latency NTP servers, PublicNTP doubles as an excellent opportunity for me to travel to relatively-exotic locations—something I enjoy immensely.

    		<p class="about__p">
					I’ve always had a passion for solving complex problems, but I’ve never liked to do it the “normal” way. For 18 years, I got a strong foundation in rigorous discipline as an Officer in the Air National Guard, while simultaneously pursuing my passion for technology in electrical engineering. Transitioning to the software development process in 2003 was a natural evolution for me. The digital product space is still the Wild West of technology, a place you can imagine an idea, prototype it quickly and cheaply, and bring it to market on your own (or at least with a small, tight team). There’s an ethos you have to follow, sure, but how you do it isn’t as important as that you get it done. Currently, I’m CIO of Boncom, a digital company I helped build from the ground up, and an author and creator of the Rebellious Learning brand. I’m a huge advocate for renegade product makers out to change the world.
