			<p class="how__paragraph">
        A time zone is a region of the earth where all the clocks are set to the same time.  This is done for two purposes: to ensure that “noon” doesn’t occur in the middle of the night, and to support legal/business/social needs for those in the same time zone.

		<h4 class="how__title">History of Time Zones</h4>
		<div class="how__third">
			<p class="how__paragraph">
        The need for time zones was a factor of the world becoming more connected.  As railroads made longer-distance travel possible, and as train schedules needed to be published, railroad companies started to keep their own time to set the clocks at the station.

			<p class="how__paragraph">
        By 1900, most of the world recognized some standard time zone, but most were relative to the time at a local observatory.  By 1929, the majority of the world had adopted time zones that were measured as an offset from the time in Greenwich, England (Greenwich Mean Time, or GMT).

		<div class="how__third">
			<p class="how__paragraph">
        Several parts of the world, primarily North America and Europe, advance the clocks during summer (typically one hour, though exceptions do exist). The original proponents for daylight saving time claimed a number of projected benefits from increasing the number of evening hours with daylight during the summer months.
